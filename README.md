# Welcome

Welcome to my small CurrenyFair project.

Data is handled simply in this app. It is consumed from a POST'd endpoint, parsed & stored in a file for summation later, & also written to a database for use as SSE's
Once a listener is opened via the index page, the results are displayed plotted on the heatmap with some GPS co-ordinates and the information on the right. Information is cleared after 15 results, but is retained on the heatmap.
The longer the page is open & the more posted data, the more rich the heatmap becomes.

Thanks for reading.

Brian.
